## FullStack developer
I am a fullstack developer with a growing love towards all things related to server-side. My journey in programming began with JavaScript and I dedicatie myself to hone my skills to become proficient in my work. 
On a daily basis, I work in `Nodejs` and `React` dedicating around 80% of my efforts to back-end development using Nodejs. 

## Activities after work  :)

## Mentor
In addition, I serve as a Nodejs mentor for students in [GoIt](https://goit.global/) . This is a role pushing me towards mastering my skills as a teacher but most importantly as a backend developer helping me to understand my craft better. 

## Public learner
I share my learning journey publicly on [www.kamilmrowka.com](https://kamilmrowka.com/). There I write about what I am currently studying or working on as well as ideas and thoughts that arise after conversations with my students.
