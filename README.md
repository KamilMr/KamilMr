## FullStack developer
I am a fullstack developer with a growing love towards all things related to server-side. My journey in programming began with JavaScript and I dedicatie myself to hone my skills to become proficient in my work.
On a daily basis, I work in `Nodejs` and `React` dedicating around 80% of my efforts to back-end development using Nodejs.

## Activities after work  :)

| priority | Free time activities        |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| 1.       | mastering nodejs            |
| 2.       | working on my side projects |
| 3.       | learning kubernetes         |
| 4.       | learning bash scripting     |

## Mentor
In addition, I served as a Nodejs mentor for students in [GoIt](https://goit.global/) . This is a role pushing me towards mastering my skills as a teacher but most importantly as a backend developer helping me to understand my craft better.

## Public learner
I share my learning journey publicly on [www.kamilmrowka.com](https://kamilmrowka.com/). There I write about what I am currently studying or working on as well as ideas and thoughts that arise after conversations with my students.

## Currently working on?
I am currently working on small modules that track my daily tasks using the terminal.
