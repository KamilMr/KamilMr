## FullStack developer
I am a passionate fullstack developer with a growing love towards all things server-side specifically backend development . My journey in programming began with  JavaScript and I’ve honed my skills to become proficient in both backend and front end development. On a daily basis, I work in Nodejs and React dedicating around 80% of my efforts to  back-end development using  Nodejs.
